## Description
It is a sunny, clear day, and I am driving a vehicle on a curved city road. There are no other vehicles in my immediate vicinity. The road is marked with a speed limit sign indicating 40 mph, and I am currently in a single lane that appears to be merging from two lanes into one, possibly due to road design or construction ahead. There's a grassy area to my right and no visible obstacles ahead on the road.

## Reasoning
Given that there are no other vehicles in my current lane and I am instructed to drive carefully, my main focus should be on adhering to traffic rules and road conditions. With the presence of a speed limit sign suggesting 40 mph, it's important to ensure I am not exceeding this limit. The road ahead is curving, so maintaining an appropriate speed for the curve is essential for safety. Since the instruction did not explicitly state a need to change lanes or adjust speed dramatically, the best course of action is to continue at a safe speed that complies with the speed limit while navigating the curve.
