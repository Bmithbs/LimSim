## Description
It was a sunny, clear day and I was driving my vehicle on a city road. There were no other vehicles in my current lane. On my right was the lawn. There was a car in front of me in the adjacent lane to my left that had a moderate distance between it and me.

## Reasoning
According to the navigation information, I need to travel to the far left lane as quickly as possible. Therefore I first need to attempt a left turn. The vehicle in front of me on my left is moderately close enough that I will not collide with it if I choose to change lanes to the left, so I can change lanes to the left.
