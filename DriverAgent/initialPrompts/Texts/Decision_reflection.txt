## Description
It was a sunny, clear day and I was driving on a curving left bend in a city road. There were trees on the right-hand side of the bend and a clear blue sky overhead. There was one other vehicle in my lane ahead of me, which appeared to be maintaining a safe driving distance.

## Reasoning
The navigation information advises to drive carefully along the current road. Considering there is another vehicle in the same    
lane ahead and the road is curving to the left, it is important to maintain a safe following distance and prepare for potential changes in the traffic flow due to the bend.
- Accelerating (AC) is not advisable because it would        
decrease the safe distance between my vehicle and the one in front.
- Slowing down (DC) is not necessary since there seems to be adequate space between my vehicle and the one ahead, and there is no indication of traffic congestion or  
hazards.
- Maintaining my current speed (IDLE) is the most appropriate action as it allows me to follow the lead vehicle safely while navigating the bend.

## Decision
IDLE
