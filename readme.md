## News: üöÄThe code is now released!
# LimSim

LimSim is a Long-term Interactive Multi-scenario traffic Simulator, which aims to provide a continuous simulation capability under the complex urban road network.


## üéÅ Main Features

- [x] **Long-term**: Traffic flow can be generated over long periods under the guidance of demand and route planning.

- [x] **Diversity**: The built-in behavioral models take heterogeneous driving styles of vehicles into account.

- [x] **Interactivity**: Vehicles in the scenario area are controlled  address sophisticated interactions among vehicles.

- [x] **Multi-scenario**: The universal road components supports a variety of road structures in the real world.

## üñ•Ô∏è GUI

LimSim has a cross-platform user-friendly GUI, which includes not only a beautiful simulation interface, but also information on road network and ego-vehicle status.

## üõ£Ô∏è Multi-scenarios support

LimSim supports road scenarios not limited to freeways, signalized intersections, roundabouts and overpasses.

## üìä Scenario Evaluation

After running a long-term simulation with all kinds of scenarios contained in it, LimSim generates a log report and extract the key scenarios via the evaluation results.

## üí°Co-sim with SUMO & CARLA

LimSim supports co-simulation with CARLA and SUMO, guaranteeing that all three softwares show identical vehicle status.

## ‚ûïAdditional Maps

LimSim supports the `freewayB` and `Expressway_A` maps from the CitySim datasets. However, we have not included these two road network files in this library due to copyright.

To run these two maps, you need to:
1. Go to [CitySim Repo](https://github.com/ozheng1993/UCF-SST-CitySim-Dataset#Full%20Data%20Access) and submit the data access form.
2. Get access to the dataset and download the **`.net.xml` files** in both the `freewayB` and `Expressway_A` data folders.
3. Copy the road network files (.net.xml) to the relevant `networkFiles/CitySim` folder and ensure that your file paths are as follows:
   ```
   networkFiles/CitySim/freewayB/freewayB.net.xml
   networkFiles/CitySim/Expressway_A/Expressway_A.net.xml
   ```
